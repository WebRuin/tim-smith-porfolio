      So... Why Hire <span>Me?</span>
    </h4>
    <p>
      I take a lot of pride in the websites I build. Whether I am building a
      simple website of only a few static pages, a large server based site, or I
      am building a web application, I take the time listen to my customers and
      build them what the want.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>Why not use Wix or Godaddy?</span>
      <br />
      You can. They work well. Although, if you want full control over your
      website and the look and feel of your website I will provide that. With me
      as your developer you will have full ownership of your site.
